# JavaScript TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error: a `TypeError` thrown when attempting to access the `length` property of an undefined value.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

This error often arises when dealing with potentially null or undefined values that are expected to be arrays or objects. Always validate your inputs before accessing their properties to avoid this issue.
